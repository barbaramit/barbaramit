### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm an undergrad in Production Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and a data analysis student. 

I have always been interested in mathematics and statistics. In college I discovered another area of interest: programming. Therefore, I have been focusing my studies on data and on improving my knowledge in statistics, python and sql. My current goal is to better understand how data behaves and extract valuable information from it. In this way, I can assist decision making through good analysis and data storytelling.

âš¡ **More about me?** I love studying languages, body language and personal development. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills, through books, courses and more. I am a tea person and I also love traveling, books and watching Formula 1 on Sundays.
